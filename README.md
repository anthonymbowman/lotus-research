This repository collects experiments around the Lotus interest-rate model.

## Simulations

- `Lotus Liquidation Simulation/` contains a Monte Carlo liquidation risk simulator.
- `lotus_market_simulation.py` showcases a simple Lotus market with five ticks (75% to 95% LT) for the wstETH/USDC pair and demonstrates the adaptive interest-rate process.

Run the market demo with:

```bash
python3 lotus_market_simulation.py
```
